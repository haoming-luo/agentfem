# Meshes, loads, and constraints

Model setup is where a finite-element tool becomes practically useful. AgentFEM
keeps imported geometry semantics, named regions, loads, constraints, boundary
models, and step activation reusable rather than embedding them in one solver.

## Mesh routes

- structured meshes for reproducible studies and tests;
- XDMF/HDF5 as the direct DOLFINx solver representation;
- optional Gmsh model and `.msh` routes;
- optional meshio conversion for external formats;
- Abaqus element-semantic inventory, set, surface, and equation parsing;
- conversion fingerprints so stale cached meshes are not silently reused.

## Common engineering actions

- prescribed displacement and temperature;
- traction, pressure, body force, gravity, centrifugal and hydrostatic loading;
- elastic foundations and boundary models;
- periodic/equation constraints;
- distributed force and moment resultants;
- step-wise activation and deactivation.

## Declare the numerical unit contract

Finite-element kernels operate on consistent numbers. Record the convention
once so manifests, agents, datasets, and future interfaces do not infer units
from magnitude:

```python
model = models.create(
    study=studies.static_solid(dimension=3),
    mesh=domain,
    units=units.n_mm_mpa(),
)
```

`units.si()` and `units.n_mm_mpa()` are ready-to-use contracts;
`units.consistent(...)` records another coherent system. AgentFEM does not
silently convert material constants in this layer.

For imported simplex meshes, run `mesh.audit_quality(..., strict=True)` before
assembly. The report is collective under MPI and records the threshold and
number of poor/invalid owned cells.
