# Meshes, loads, and constraints

Model setup is where a finite-element tool becomes practically useful. AgentFEM
keeps imported geometry semantics, named regions, loads, constraints, boundary
models, and step activation reusable rather than embedding them in one solver.

## Mesh routes

- structured meshes for reproducible studies and tests;
- XDMF/HDF5 as the direct DOLFINx solver representation;
- optional Gmsh model and `.msh` routes;
- optional meshio conversion for external formats;
- Abaqus quadratic-tetrahedron, set, surface, and equation parsing;
- conversion fingerprints so stale cached meshes are not silently reused.

## Common engineering actions

- prescribed displacement and temperature;
- traction, pressure, body force, gravity, centrifugal and hydrostatic loading;
- elastic foundations and boundary models;
- periodic/equation constraints;
- distributed force and moment resultants;
- step-wise activation and deactivation.
